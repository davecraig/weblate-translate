,"You can think of the audible beacon as a *""lighthouse for the ears""*, notifying you of where your destination is relative to your location, as the crow flies. Like a lighthouse, it does not tell you how to get there – you may need to make many navigation choices along the way, just as a sailboat will have to make many strategic *""tacks""* to get closer to the lighthouse. The continuous rhythmic sound of the audible beacon is spatialized from the direction of the destination, and helps you stay aware of the location of the destination relative to you as you walk. When you are walking directly toward the destination, or you point the phone toward the destination, a higher pitched *""ring""* sound will be heard. This feature allows you to pinpoint the direction of the destination since the direction of the rhythmic sound can sometimes be difficult to perceive in loud environments. When searching for the higher pitched *""ring""*, hold the phone flat and sweep the phone slowly; turning your head to point in the same direction of the phone will ensure that you have the best spatial audio experience.

The lighthouse metaphor for the beacon’s design has several natural implications:

1. There is no *""correct""* direction to travel when using the beacon, instead, with Soundscape you choose how to get there;

2. The higher pitched *""ring""* helps you pinpoint the direction of the destination only – it is not an indication of how you should get there;

3.

The main changes in this release are for *Search* and describing the current address. When there is network available, *Search* will use Android as well as our own Photon server to find places. The main improvements here are firstly that searching by street number should work much better in many parts of the world. Secondly, we have also added offline search which uses any downloaded maps to search for addresses and points of interest. Offline search works up to around 5 miles around the user.

Tips for searching:

The search UI has changed slightly since the last release as it didn't correctly support talkback editing. It also requires the user to hit enter/search to start the search after entering the search text.

Offline search requires offline maps to be downloaded. Download them from the Settings/Offline maps screen.

Searching can be forced to be offline only in the settings. The default Auto setting means that it uses online search when there's network available and offline search when there's none.

When searching for a street address, including the town name is important for online search, though it can be omitted in offline search.

Mapping of street numbers in the OpenStreetMap data that we use varies depending on location. Offline search will use street numbers when they are available, though an offline map downloaded in the app after January 19th 2026 is required.

As always please report any problems, however small they may be via the *Contact Support* option in the main menu.
