#Soundscape for Android — How It Works (User Perspective)

## What it is:
Soundscape is an app that helps you explore and navigate the world using 3D audio cues. Instead of staring at a map or following turn-by-turn instructions, you listen: the app places sounds around you so you can build a mental picture of what’s nearby and where to go.

## Getting Started

On first use, the app asks for permission to access your location so it can track where you are.

You wear headphones (ideally ones that keep your ears open, like bone-conduction headphones) so you can hear the app while staying aware of traffic and other sounds around you.

Once running, Soundscape starts describing your surroundings in real time.

## Key Features

### Audio beacons
You can set an audio beacon on a place you want to head toward — like a bus stop, shop, or your home.

The audio beacon makes a distinctive sound that comes from the actual direction of that place.

As you move closer, the sound becomes more noticeable, guiding you naturally without step-by-step commands.

### Markers
Save your own points of interest — such as a café, friend’s house, or useful shortcut.

You can return to them later, guided by the same 3D audio cues.

### Routes
Create a route by linking a series of markers together.

As you follow it, the app guides you from one marker to the next, like stepping stones.

Routes are especially useful for familiar journeys, such as from home to a bus stop, then on to a train station.

### Information Buttons
My Location: tells you where you are and which way you’re facing.

Around Me: describes what’s in all directions, helping you build a mental map of your surroundings.

Ahead of Me: focuses only on what lies straight ahead, so you know what’s coming up.

### Continuous Orientation
As you walk, the app updates in real time based on your location and direction.

Sounds shift naturally as you turn your head or body, reinforcing your sense of direction.

### Background Awareness

Soundscape is designed to keep running in the background.

This means you can use other apps while still hearing Soundscape’s gentle cues about what’s around you.

### Street and Landmark Callouts
As you pass streets, intersections, or notable landmarks, the app can announce them.

This helps you stay oriented and builds confidence in understanding your surroundings.

### Virtual Exploration

You can explore an area virtually before going there.

By previewing a street or neighbourhood, you hear what landmarks, roads, or intersections are nearby, so you’re more familiar when you arrive.

### Customisable Information
You can choose how much information the app provides.

Some people prefer frequent announcements, while others like a quieter experience with only key details.

This flexibility means you can adjust the app depending on whether you’re in a busy city or a quieter area.

### Everyday Use
Exploring a new place: Wander freely while the app tells you about streets and landmarks around you.

Heading somewhere specific: Set a beacon and follow the sound until you arrive.

Making regular journeys: Save and follow a route so you can repeat it with ease.

Learning an area in advance: Use virtual exploration to get familiar with a location before visiting.

Building awareness: Even if you’re not headed anywhere in particular, Soundscape helps you stay aware of what’s around.

### Why It’s Different
Instead of telling you exactly when to turn left or right, Soundscape focuses on ambient awareness. It helps you understand the layout of your environment and stay in control of your movements, offering confidence and independence while travelling.
